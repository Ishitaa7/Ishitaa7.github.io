Hi! I’m a Mathematics and Electronics dual major at BITS Pilani, and I’m excited about exploring the intersection of NLP, Machine Learning, and bio-engineering. When I’m not working on projects, you’ll probably find me reading about history. I’m also on the lookout for a year-long thesis opportunity starting in May 2025—[let’s connect](mailto: ishitaraj5173@gmail.com)! 

In the past, I was a research intern at [Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics](https://bisag-n.gov.in), a central government scientific society where I led efforts on visualizing large scale data for understanding weather patterns across various regions. I also collaborated with [Prof. Srinivasa Prasad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0XKrN5oAAAAJ&hl=en) on Spike Sorting Analysis of Single-Channel Electrophysiological Data. 

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Prajna Devi Upadhyay](https://www.prajnaupadhyay.com) on Machine Translation of Low Resource Languages and with [Prof. Aneesh Chivukula](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S7Wm3HoAAAAJ&hl=en) on Computational Sanskrit.
